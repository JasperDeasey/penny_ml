Penny ML is a machine-learning project, which analyzes trades of micro-cap companies, and can "steal" trades to build a portfolio. A website explaining the strategy and results is here: [https://jasperdeasey.github.io/penny_ml/](https://jasperdeasey.github.io/penny_ml/)

This project was developed to improve my knowledge of quantitative funds and machine learning.
